# User Data Deletion Endpoint Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive `delUserData` endpoint that completely removes a user's record and all associated data from the database.

## Endpoint Details
- **Route**: `DELETE /delUserData`
- **Authentication**: Requires user authentication (uses `isUser_Authenticated` middleware)
- **Purpose**: Completely deletes all user data from all related collections in the database

## Collections Affected
The endpoint removes user data from the following 9 collections:

1. **ResetToken** - User's password reset tokens
2. **Notification** - User's notifications
3. **Transaction** - User's transaction history
4. **Match** - User's match records
5. **CoachAssignment** - Coach assignments where user is the player
6. **Subscription** - User's billing/subscription data
7. **CustomMatch** - Custom match participations
8. **Leaderboard** - Leaderboard records where user won (gold, silver, bronze)
9. **Coach.comment** - User's comments on coaches (nested removal with rating recalculation)
10. **User** - Main user record (deleted last)

## Special Handling

### Coach Comments
- Finds all coaches that have comments from the user
- Removes the user's comments from each coach
- Recalculates the coach's average rating after removing the user's comments
- Sets average rating to 0 if no comments remain

### Leaderboard Records
- Removes leaderboard entries where the user won any position (gold, silver, bronze)
- Uses `$or` query to find all relevant records

### Custom Matches
- Removes custom matches where the user participated
- Uses `participants.userId` query to find matches

## Response Format
```json
{
  "message": "User data completely deleted from all collections",
  "deletionSummary": {
    "userId": "user_id_here",
    "userDeleted": true,
    "resetTokensDeleted": 2,
    "notificationsDeleted": 15,
    "transactionsDeleted": 8,
    "matchesDeleted": 12,
    "coachAssignmentsDeleted": 1,
    "subscriptionsDeleted": 1,
    "customMatchesDeleted": 3,
    "leaderboardsDeleted": 2,
    "coachCommentsRemoved": 5,
    "totalCollectionsAffected": 9
  }
}
```

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch block
- Detailed logging for each deletion step
- Returns error details if deletion fails
- Continues with remaining deletions even if some fail

## Security
- User can only delete their own data (authenticated user's ID is used)
- No admin privileges required - users can self-delete
- Irreversible operation - no soft delete

## Usage
```bash
DELETE /delUserData
Authorization: Bearer <user_token>
```

## File Location
`api/server/src/routes/user/controllers/handleUser.ts`

## Integration
- Properly registered in user plugin (`api/server/src/routes/user/plugin.ts`)
- Available through main server routes
- Uses existing authentication middleware
